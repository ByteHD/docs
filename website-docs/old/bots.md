Enjuu has a few bots you can contact in-game that can do some awesome things! Here's a list of some of those, to get started, contact them in game. If you're interested in adapting your bot to Enjuu, feel free to do it! Enjuu's API covers most endpoints of osu!'s official API, although it has a lot of other features, which will be released hopefully soon. If you're interested on getting help with the API, join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/0rJcZruIsA6rXuIx) #api channel. If you want to get a bot account, contact [support](mailto:support@Enjuu.click). If you want to add a bot to this list, contact [Howl](mailto:howl@Enjuu.click), either via email or through Discord.
