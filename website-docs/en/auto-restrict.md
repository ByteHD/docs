First at all, only players who set a 700pp+ score get auto-restricted. This only apply to osu!standard. If this happens you can message **BaronVonAnime#0013** on Discord. If you have a verified Badge you can message other Admins too. If you don't have discord you can message **baron@enjuu.click** but he only checks it every Friday.
