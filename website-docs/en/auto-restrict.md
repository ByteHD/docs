First at all, only players with a 700pp+ score get auto-restricted. This only apply to the osu! mode. If this happens you can write **BaronVonAnime#0013** a message, If you have a verified Badge you can message other Admins too. If you don't have discord you can message **baron@enjuu.click** but he only checks it every Friday.
