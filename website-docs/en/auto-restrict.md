First of all, only players who set a 700pp+ score will get auto-restricted. This restriction only applies to the osu!standard mode. If this happens to you, you can message **BaronVonAnime#0013** on Discord. If you have a verified badge you can message other admins too. If you don't have Discord, you can message **baron@enjuu.click** (be aware that this email is only checked regularly every friday)
